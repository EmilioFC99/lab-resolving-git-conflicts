I'm Emilio Flores, I'm 20 years old, I'm from Mexico. 
I play videogames like LoL, Genshin Impact and Rainbow 6, I like to read (personal growth, fiction, novels, etc.) and I like to spend time with my gf (going out, cooking, doing exercise, anything.) 
I'm currently out of school cause COVID but I was coursing the 6th semester of Systems Engineer so I know how to code, but no how data is used.

Why are we still here? Just to suffer.

In my last semester I had I.A and I really liked it so I asked my professor what were the applications for the I.A and one of them were Data Analysis and like 1 or 2 months later Rappi was giving Ironhack scholarships. So here I am. I want to know at leat the basics about how data can be classified, algorithms, tips, how to implement my code and how to show what I got from the data.

I would like to work in Google or in any of the new big companys like Uber, AirBnB, Rappi, Starbuck, Oxxo. And then got some friends to make our own software so we can help SMEs grow faster.
