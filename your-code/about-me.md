My name is Emilio Flores but my friends call me Lopso, I like playing videogames on my PC, currently I play LoL, Genshin Impact and Rainbow 6. Reading is my second favorite hobby, The Witcher Saga and Ender's Game are my fav fiction books. I hear music like 80% of the time - Virtual Riot, AU5, Deadmau5 and Geoxor are my favorites. -

I started in the world of spirituality in the beginning of the year, and right now I like to meditate and be more aware of what I do in my life so my anxiety doesn't grow.
